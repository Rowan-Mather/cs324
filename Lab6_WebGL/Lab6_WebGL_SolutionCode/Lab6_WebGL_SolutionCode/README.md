1. Try this: What happens if you change the value of diffuse to something like 3.0? [Solution](./TryThis/TryThisAnswers.txt)

## Exercises:
1.

[Solution](./Exercise-1/Ex1-2ColourParticleDiffusion/)
2. In ParticleDiffusion the initial position of the particles is assigned randomly. Can you create a single spawning point instead? See Figure 6.3, Right. [Solution](./Exercise-2/Ex2-SpawnParticleDiffusion/)
